      <h2>Introduction to PNG Compression</h2>
      <p>PNG compression has come a long way since its inception. In 2025, we have access to advanced algorithms and techniques that can significantly reduce file sizes while maintaining image quality.</p>

      <h2>Understanding PNG Compression</h2>
      <p>PNG uses lossless compression, meaning no image quality is lost during the compression process. This makes it ideal for images that require high quality and transparency.</p>

      <h2>Advanced Compression Techniques</h2>
      <p>Modern compression algorithms can analyze image data patterns and optimize accordingly. This includes color palette optimization, bit depth reduction, and intelligent transparency handling.</p>

      <h2>Best Practices for Optimal Compression</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Choose the right color mode (RGB vs. Indexed)</li>
        <li>Remove unnecessary metadata</li>
        <li>Optimize transparency</li>
        <li>Use appropriate bit depth</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Future of PNG Compression</h2>
      <p>As we look ahead, AI-powered compression algorithms and new optimization techniques are emerging, promising even better results for PNG compression.</p>
